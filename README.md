# gabiro

A free, self-hosted, agent-first diagram tool. AI agents (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, …) call gabiro's MCP tools to draw your system as **architecture, flowchart, sequence, ERD, mind map, freeform and kanban** boards. Boards are JSON files in your repo (`.gabiro/boards/`), and every change is auto-exported to Mermaid Markdown (`docs/diagrams/`) so it renders on GitHub and lives in git next to the code.

> The live browser canvas is coming in the next milestone. Today you get the MCP server plus Mermaid exports.

## Install (from source)

```bash
git clone <this repo> gabiro && cd gabiro
npm install
npm run build
```

Register it with Claude Code **from inside the project you want to diagram**:

```bash
claude mcp add gabiro -- node /absolute/path/to/gabiro/dist/cli.js mcp
```

The server uses the directory it is started in as the project root. Pass `--root <dir>` to override.

## Use

Ask your agent things like:

- "Map this repo's architecture as a gabiro board."
- "Draw the sequence of our login flow, from the browser through the auth service to the DB."
- "Make an ERD of the Prisma schema."
- "Add a Redis cache between the API and Postgres, and a sticky note about invalidation."

Then open `docs/diagrams/<board>.md` (it renders on GitHub or in VS Code's Markdown preview).

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `gabiro_list_boards` | List boards |
| `gabiro_create_board` | Create a board, optionally with all of its content in one call |
| `gabiro_get_board` | Read a board as `summary`, `json` or `mermaid` |
| `gabiro_apply_changes` | Atomic batch of add/update/remove ops for nodes, edges and groups |
| `gabiro_update_board` | Rename a board or change its direction |
| `gabiro_auto_layout` | Re-run layout (pinned nodes stay unless `force`) |
| `gabiro_export` | Mermaid or Markdown, optionally written to disk |
| `gabiro_delete_board` | Delete a board and its export |

## Config

`.gabiro/config.json` (optional):

```json
{ "autoExport": true, "exportDir": "docs/diagrams" }
```

## Develop

```bash
npm test          # unit + MCP tests (the stdio e2e test runs after `npm run build`)
npm run typecheck
```
